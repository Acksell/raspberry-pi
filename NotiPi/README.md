# NotiPi
(A word play on Notify and raspberry pi)
Runs a flask server on the raspberry pi on the local network. Forwards messages to a specified
Discord channel and make the raspberry pi buzz to indicate a message was received.

## Why?

My headphones are very good at isolating sound and instead of anyone having to knock on 
my door or scream their lungs out to reach me they can just visit the site at 
`raspberrypi:5000`, enter their message and it will be forwarded to me immediately.
